# PHY Game

PHY is a simulator program that describes the action, behavior and motion
of different types of physical elements: bodies, force fields and spaces.
Using the software, one can easily study the effects created by systems of forces
that are hard to understand in the real world.

## Run

`mvn clean install`
`java -jar target/phy-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Help in operating

In the popup window we can declare the initial state of our object. For faster
declaration use the mouse’s right button, click, hold and drag the drawing canvas
to specify the main attributes. The corresponding values in numbers will immediately
appear in the small window’s text fields.

For more detailed description please refer to the *PHY Software Documentation.docx* file.
